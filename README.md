A desktop client (menubar app) of 
[Bing Wallpaper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/bing-wallpaper)
by Microsoft for mac, written in swift. 

I don't own any right to the wallpapers, they come from Microsoft.

An alpha version of the app is released. Install 
[here](https://github.com/RuideFu/Bing-Wallpaper-For-Mac-4K-with-GUI/releases/download/v1.0-alpha/Bing.Wallpaper.for.Mac.-alpha.dmg)
